# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
 - I'm feeling confident in these
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
 - These make sense to me as well.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
 - I get it but sometimes I'm not sure what the questions in the exercises want from me. I need to understand the terminology better.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
 - A lot longer than I thought I would. Sharing to video has been cumbersome.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
 - I should give myself extra time for cloning from GitHub.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 - I've been lucky enough so far to work through with others as questions came or Google.
